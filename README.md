### Instructions:
- **Guess a 5-letter word**: Start by typing a 5-letter word into the input box.
- **Submit your guess**: Click the "Submit" button to check your guess.
-**Feedback**:
  - **Green**: The letter is in the correct position.
  - **Yellow**: The letter is in the word, but in the wrong position.
  - **Grey**: The letter is not in the word.
  - **Keep guessing**: Use the feedback to help you make your next guess. You have six tries to guess the word.
- **Win/Lose**: If you guess the word correctly within the six tries, you win! If not, the game ends.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript**

## Next Steps:
I would like to implement the following:
- **Streak**: A counter that shows how many words the player has gotten correct in a row.
- **Daily Mode**: A mode where like the original game, everyday will have a new word.
- **Hard Mode**: This mode will have a larger list of more difficult words and the words will vary from 5 letters to more letters.
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Optimize for play on mobile devices.
